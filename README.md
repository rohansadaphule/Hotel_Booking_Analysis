**Project Overview:**

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a hotel booking dataset. The goal was to
uncover key insights that can inform strategic decisions for the hotel business, including revenue generation,
customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

**Dataset:**

**Key Objectives:**

*   Identify peak booking periods.
*   Determine popular room types and booking locations.
*   Understand customer cancellation patterns.
*   Assess the impact of lead time and booking channels on bookings and cancellations.

**Methodology:**

The analysis involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Initial data loading and preprocessing, including handling missing values and
data type conversions.
2.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical
features.
3.  **Univariate Analysis:** Examining the distribution of individual variables using histograms, box plots, and
bar charts.
4.  **Bivariate Analysis:** Investigating relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and
correlation matrices.
5.  **Visualization:** Creating informative charts and graphs to communicate findings.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Peak Booking Times:** July and August exhibit the highest booking volumes.
*   **Popular Location:** City hotels are significantly favored.
*   **Preferred Room Type:** Room Type A is the most popular.
*   **Top Originating Countries:** Portugal and Great Britain are leading booking sources.
*   **Stay Length:** Guests typically book stays of 1-4 days.
*   **Customer Loyalty:** City Hotels show a higher percentage of repeat guests.
*   **Cancellation Rate:** Approximately 25% of bookings are canceled, with City Hotels having a higher rate.
*   **Cancellation Patterns:** New guests are more likely to cancel than repeat customers.
*   **Lead Time Impact:** Lead time and waiting lists do not influence cancellation decisions.
*   **Booking Channel Impact:** Corporate bookings have a higher percentage of repeat guests, while Tourists/Other
(TA/TO) have the lowest.
*   **Price Sensitivity:** Guests tend to reduce their stay duration as ADR (Average Daily Rate) increases.
*   **Correlation:** Strong positive correlation between Lead Time and Number of Days in Waiting List.

**Next Steps (Potential):**

*   **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a model to predict booking demand or cancellation rates.
*   **Customer Segmentation:** Create more sophisticated customer segments based on booking behavior.
*   **A/B Testing:** Design experiments to test the impact of pricing strategies or marketing campaigns.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** Explore trends in booking patterns over time.
